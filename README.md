## How to run tests
- **Running all tests:** `npm test`
- **Running beginner tests:** `npm test beginner`
    - Optionally, you can run tests per part, so if you wanted to run all the part 1 tests, you can use `npm test part1`
- **Running intermediate tests:** `npm test intermediate`
    - For the `bloodBank.js` and `spookyTown.js` exercises you may optionally choose to run tests for each individual task with `npm test bloodbank` or `npm test spookytown`
- **Running advanced tests:** `npm test advanced`
